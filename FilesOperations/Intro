In this project we do following files operations in a folder from user taking files names…

First customer enter its choice to do operations :-
1.If he enters 1 then he want to add file in a folder . Then he will enter file name and then that file will be created and add into that folder .
2.If he enters 2 then he want to delete file in a folder . Then he will enter file name which he want to delete . Then after that first check that file exists in folder or not . If file found then delete that file otherwise it will show file not found (invalid file).
3.If he enters 3 then he want to search file in folder and then enter file name to search . If file found then it will show file found otherwise not found . 
4.If he enter 4 then he will exit from the file operation.

Note :- In all these file operations files will be sorted in ascending order .
